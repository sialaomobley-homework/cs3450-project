# Tool Storage Database & Web Application
This project will allow a community tool rental service to digitize their tool inventory and rental ability. The owners of the service will be able to add and remove tools from the website along with other abilities. The community members will, after creating an account, be able to see the tools available and rent tools online. 

## Organization and Name Scheme
Because the web application will be implemented with Django, conventional Django file organization and naming schemes will be used in this project. 

## Version Control
We will be using the Git version control protocol, hosting our project on a GitHub repository. Specifics will be decided with individual assignments, allowing for custom version control procedures as needed. 

## Tool Stack & Setup
The website frontend will be made with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It will be hosted on a Django server written in Python 3. The database will be implemented through Django as well using SQL. We will perform unit tests using the Jest framework. 

## Build Instructions
Django must be hosted on a server to function. During the development process, team members will use their preferred server hosting tools on their PCs as needed. As each tool has its own unique interface, detailed build instructions are not available at this time. 

The final product will either be set up to run on an online hosting service or on a server machine to be purchased by the tool rental group and maintained by our team of brilliant, hardworking software engineers. Both options will require a regular fee to be paid by the tool rental group, with the second option including a modest increase to compensate the tireless software developers for their upkeep efforts.
## Unit Testing
On the front end, unit tests will be implemented through the testing framework Jest. 
## System Testing
System testing will be performed through manually attempting to fulfill our listed use cases as well as a set of additional edge cases which will be determined over the course of the testing process. 
## Additional Notes
All of the content written above may be subject to change at any time. The contents of this repository have been written and/or designed by members of the team "Swift Taylor" of Utah State University circa 2020. These contents are not free for public use. 

The members of Swift Taylor are highly motivated and excited to be working on this project. Unfortunately, as a group, we lack practical experience in the field and practices of software engineering, and as such misunderstandings of project requirements may occur. If our group is made aware of such misunderstandings, we will seek to correct our errors swiftly and efficiently.
